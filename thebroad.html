              <h4>Companion App Proposal</h4>
              
              <br><p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
              <p>A recent trip to The Broad art museum left a classmate feeling confused about how to make the most of their trip. They were overwhelmed by the size of the museum, and they didn't know the best way to navigate or find special exhibits.</p>
              <p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
              <p>With a companion app, the user can plan a trip to the museum, purchase tickets, find general information about the Broad (such as activities, hours discount days, visiting exhibits), find information on art pieces and exhibits (such as the artists’ backstory or time period overview), and connect to the art once they leave (by bookmarking their favorite paintings/artists and accessing recommendations).</p>
              <p>The companion app will make museum-goers' lives easier by providing a central place to access museum information, guide users to avoid getting lost at the museum, eliminate wait times, and allow users to go through the museum their own way.</p>
              <p>This will give our users a sense of enjoyment being at the museum and a sense of satisfaction when they leave and reflect on their past experience.
              </p>
              
              
              <br><br><h4>User Personas</h4>
              <br><p>The Art Novice</p>
              <ul>
                  
                  <li>This class of users involve those who are occasional visitors to art museums or may have never even been to one. They may be going with their families while on vacation so they’re knowledge of the museum is very new.</li>
                  <li>Their goals are to plan their trip, visit the museum, and to just enjoy the experience overall.</li>
                  <li>The expectation of the Art Novice is to have a smooth visit to The Broad with no problems or stress from planning, getting to the museum, going to each exhibit, and figuring out what else to do at the art museum.</li>
                  <li>These users can experience visiting The Broad as exciting, new, relaxing.</li>
              </ul><br>

              <p>The Art Enthusiast</p>
              <ul>
                  
                  <li>These users frequently visit art museums, have a deep knowledge of art, and may or may not have visited The Broad multiple times.</li>
                  <li>Their goal is to visit the Broad to see certain artwork they like either for relaxation or to study and participate in activities they haven’t done before. Their goals are specific.</li>
                  <li>The expectation of an Art Enthusiast should be to have a distinctive experience or vibe of the place since they’ve been to other art museums. They come to this museum with a particular goal in mind unlike the Art Novice who wants an overall experience of The Broad.</li>
                  <li>The experience of these users can range from excitement to work to passion for The Broad.</li>
              </ul>
              
              
              <br><br><h4>Usability Testing</h4>
              <br><p>First Task Scenario</p>
              
              <p><i>You and your family are interested in going to The Broad, but you don’t know much about the museum, so you download the Experience the Broad app. You register for an account, and then use the calendar feature to find the museum’s available days.</i></p>
              
              <p><i>You see that the museum is having a “Family Discount Day” two weekends from now. This is a great deal, so you select that Saturday and select a time slot for 12-5pm. You enter the number of tickets you’d like to purchase and fill in your payment information. You are then presented with digital tickets you can use to enter the museum in two weekends. </i></p>
              
              <ul>
              
              <li><strong>Task 1</strong> <br>Can you register for an account?</li>
              <li><strong>Task 2</strong> <br>Can you find which days the museum is available using the in-app calendar? <br>How would you determine whether there are any discount days coming up for the museum?</li>
              <li><strong>Task 3</strong> <br>How would you book tickets for 4 people for a 12-5pm time slot on a museum discount day? </li>
